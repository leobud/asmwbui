To check decay time on any structure or dino, target them with your crosshair and type /decaytime for the time remaining. \r\n \r\n Structures that have less than 10 items will decay in 2 days (usually for unmanned taming pens).  \r\n\r\n ANY item that is the same as the recipe is disabled. \r\n\r\n Do NOT use names like 123 or Human, and do NOT use profanity or derogatory names — these will be renamed.\r\n \r\n This is a US server. Please only speak English in General Chat."

Multiple infractions will result in a ban. \n \n - Do not use derogatory or offensive names. Your character will be renamed. \n \n - No excessive structure spam (pillars, foundations, etc.). \n \n - No building or blocking caves, artifacts, or loot crates, or concentrated resource areas (6+ nodes). \n \n - No blocking obelisks. \n \n - No hacking or exploiting game bugs. \n \n - No kiting dinos into bases to kill dinos or destroy structures. This results in an immediate ban. \n \n - No blocking resource spawns or harassing with nearby structures. \n \n - Random structures or 'spot holding' will cause ALL tribe structures to be wiped."

Max 10 dinos out per tribe, except production dinos (e.g., gachas, breeders).\n\n- No racism or bullying — zero tolerance.\n\n- Do not give or trade high-tier items or tames to low-level players; they must earn progression themselves.\n\n- Abusing any mechanic or bug may result in a ban.\n\n- Wild teleporters must be public. Private teleporters will be limited to one per tribe.\n\n- Do not leech boss fights or AOE loot events.\n\n- Do not assist new players in obtaining eggs from wyvern trenches or similar content — they must do so independently.\n\n- No breeding of genderless mod dinos (they’re too overpowered)."
